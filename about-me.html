            <h2>About-Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 19-year-old student currently in 12th grade. I am proud to be the top student in my class and recognized as one of the brightest talents in my school. Alongside my academic success, I am also a skilled artist with a passion for painting. I have strong command over the English language and have even worked as an English teacher for one year at Nasim Rahmat Private School, where I gained valuable teaching experience.</p>
            <p>I have a wide range of interests that keep me curious and motivated. I love painting, solving math problems, and challenging myself with IQ questions. I am also fascinated by astronomy and enjoy exploring the mysteries of the stars. Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in coding and technology. In the future, my dream is to become a successful and well-known entrepreneur recognized around the world.</p>
