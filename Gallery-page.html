            <p id="location">The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941,[3] acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Described as a "touchstone of modern art", The Starry Night has been regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western canon.</p>

              <p>Girl with a Pearl Earring" is a well-known oil painting by Johannes Vermeer, created around 1665, and is one of his most celebrated works. It's an example of the "tronie" genre, depicting an imaginary figure rather than a portrait of a specific person. The painting is known for its subtle use of light and color, particularly on the girl's face and the pearl earring, which is a significant feature of the work.</p>

            <p>The Scream is an art composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.</p>
